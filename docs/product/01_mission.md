## Mission Statement

**Swaperex is a non-custodial DEX aggregator for retail crypto traders who want to swap tokens on Ethereum and BSC with confidence — removing the need to compare prices, routes, and liquidity across multiple DEXs — by executing the best available trade instantly, not just showing charts like DexScreener.**

## Mission Breakdown

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Who is the user?** | Retail crypto traders on ETH/BSC who hold tokens in self-custody wallets |
| **What pain do we remove?** | Manually comparing rates across Uniswap, PancakeSwap, 1inch, etc. — we aggregate and find the best route automatically |
| **Why better than DexScreener?** | DexScreener is analytics-only (charts, volume, pairs). Swaperex is action-first — see a token, swap it in one click, with best execution guaranteed |

## Core Product Pillars

1. **Non-custodial** — All signing in user's wallet, zero fund custody
2. **Best execution** — Aggregates 1inch, 0x, Paraswap for optimal rates
3. **Action-first** — Every screen leads to a swap (Screener → Swap, Portfolio → Swap)
4. **Simplicity** — No DeFi complexity, just "swap X for Y"
